        "A File Integrity Checker is a security tool that monitors files for unauthorized or unintended changes. It works by calculating cryptographic hash values (SHA-256) for each file and storing them as a trusted baseline. On subsequent checks, the tool recalculates the hash values and compares them with the stored hashes to detect file modifications, additions, or deletions. Any change in a file’s content results in a different hash value, allowing the system to accurately identify integrity violations and ensure data authenticity."
